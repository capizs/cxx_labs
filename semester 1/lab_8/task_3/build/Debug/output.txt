For centuries, QWA(a) the legend OF(o) Atlantis, the lost city buried beneath the waves, has captivated the human imagination. First mentioned by Plato in his works Timaeus and Critias, Atlantis was described as an island larger than the combined areas OF(o) Libya and Asia, boasting A(a) flourishing civilization, advanced technology and formidable military might. According to Plato, Atlantis was inhabited by descendants OF(o) the god Poseidon, who divided the island among his ten sons. Each OF(o) these sons became the ruler OF(o) their own kingdom, and together they established A(a) prosperous empire. The Atlanteans possessed extensive knowledge in the fields OF(o) architecture, engineering and maritime affairs. They constructed magnificent temples, palaces and canals that connected the interior OF(o) the island with the sea. Over the centuries, the tale OF(o) Atlantis has enthralled countless explorers, adventurers and dreamers. From the Spanish conqueror Hernando de Soto, who sought A(a) lost city in America, to the 19th-century explorer Ignatius Donnelly, who claimed that Atlantis had once existed, the legend has continued to inspire.
